# copyfilemon-brunch

 Inspired from assetsmanager-brunch, i make a similar uses quickly-copy-file plugin.

```nodejs
npm -i copyfilemon-brunch
```

demo of use:
```javascript
plugins:{
  copyfilemon:{
    filesToCopy{
      folderCopyToIn:["files", "foldercontent"]
    },    
    public: "public" //this is not an obligatory, by default 'public'
  }
}
```


You can copy file by file, or if you desired copy a folder structure and files content.
